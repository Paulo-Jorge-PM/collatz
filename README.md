# Collatz conjecture #

This is a calculator for the amazing Collatz Conjecture. It is simply made in javascript, but embeded it in an web2py app just because the server I had only was configured for it. You can ignore everything except the index.html page inside the "views" folder: there you can find the Javascript for this.

Everyone can use this in any way they like, I don't care about licenses or copyright, just have fun.
