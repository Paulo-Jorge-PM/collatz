# Collatz conjecture #

This is a calculator for the amazing Collatz Conjecture. It is simply made in javascript, but embeded in an web2py app (Python) just for hosting reasons. You can ignore everything except the index.html page inside the "views" folder: there you can find the Javascript source.

Everyone can use this in any way they like, open-source license.

You can check this calculator running at: [http://cehum.ilch.uminho.pt/collatz](http://cehum.ilch.uminho.pt/collatz)
